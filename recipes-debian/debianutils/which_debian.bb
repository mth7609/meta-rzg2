SUMMARY = "locate a command"
DESCRIPTION = "which returns the pathnames of the files (or links) \
which would be executed in the current environment, had its arguments \
been given as commands in a strictly POSIX-conformant shell.  \
It does this by searching the PATH for executable files matching \
the names of the arguments. It does not canon‚Äêicalize path names."
