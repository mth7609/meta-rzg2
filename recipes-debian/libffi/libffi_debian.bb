SUMMARY = "A portable foreign function interface library"
HOMEPAGE = "http://sourceware.org/libffi/"
DESCRIPTION = "The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming interface to various calling \
conventions.  This allows a programmer to call any function specified by a call interface description at run \
time. FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function interface is the popular name for the \
interface that allows code written in one language to call code written in another language.  The `libffi' \
library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.  \
A layer must exist above `libffi' that handles type conversions for values passed between the two languages."
